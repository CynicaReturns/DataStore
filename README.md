# Cynica's DataStore Module

A ModuleScript located in ReplicatedStorage, name it whatever you want would recommend "DataStore";
A normal Script located in ServerScriptService that will handle all the Data given;

You can just copy the whole thing, I built in a README Script so you can customize the Module for your game :)
